            <h1>Revisiting Factorizing Aggregated Posterior in Learning Disentangled Representations
                <br/></h1>
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05739">To actually read our paper in pdf in depth!</a>

            <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> (In case it's too long you don't read XD) We analyse conditions for
                disentanglement of VAE latent representations from the perspective of total correlation,
                explaining how Total Correlation (TC) of the mean representation can be high even if TC of samples is
                low.
                Building on this, a new regularizer is proposed, and its properties are illustrated on
                benchmark and artificial data.<br>

                Okay, since you are already here, I believe you should have some ideas about what we are doing here. You
                might be wondering why I am talking about our own paper...unfortunately, this work missed the <q>criteria</q>
                for top-tier conference by just a tiny bit, and I am not here to blast the conference bureaucracy with
                my cynical satires.
                But I think it might be of value to the greater community to
                see some of the reviews and discussion we got about this work and offer our view points.
                <br>
                Let's go down the list: </p>

                                for clear responses. Based on other reviews and your response I retain my overall
                                evaluation. The paper has clearly potential and may become an important contribution for
                                disentangled VAEs, but in the current form it feels a bit too heuristic and this may
                                limit the impact. If you were able to better justify the objective (the suggestion that
                                you can generalize the theorem also beyond normal distribution is a good start) the
                                paper would become stronger, and combined with slightly stronger empirical results you
                                could have a great paper.<br><br><br>Novelty: The basic observation of discrepancy
                                between mean and sample-based TC has already been pointed out by Locatello et al.
                                (2018). While having a more detailed analysis of this is valuable, the analysis in this
                                work is restricted for normal distributions for which the result follows fairly directly
                                from the definition. The new algorithm is minor variant of TC-VAE.<br><br>Soundness: The
                                development seems to be correct and reasonable, but the essential choices are motivated
                                on rather high level. For the RTC-VAE method itself, the authors simply state it
                                "originates from the first term of the law of total covariance" and proceed to discuss
                                how it may seem a bit counter-intuitive, never really justifying it properly. Similar
                                line of reasoning could have been written for various other regularisers as well, and it
                                is not at all apparent from the paper why this particular one is ideal.<br><br>Impact:
                                There is considerable body of literature on this general theme, with a lot of papers
                                being published continuously. The paper has high risk of falling into the category of
                                "yet another VAE variant for disentanglement", but naturally also has the potential of
                                notable impact in case it turns out to have exceptionally good empirical performance.
                                This is hard to evaluate due to lack of quantitative demonstrations in applications of
                                interest.<br><br>Clarity: The paper is fairly well written, but mathematical derivations
                                are sometimes unnecessarily verbose and convoluted; Theorem 1 is difficult to reason
                                about, and all of the proofs (especially Proposition 1) in Supplement are very lengthy
                                compared to what would be sufficient.<br><br>Evaluation: The evaluations are reasonable,
                                but somewhat qualitative (as tends to be the case for disentanglement works). While the
                                experiments shed light on how the method works, they do not provide grounds for very
                                strong conclusions. In particular, it is very hard to evaluate what is the practical
                                value of the proposed methodology.<br><br>Overall, the paper contributes to an important
                                topic, as shown by significant number of papers addressing it, and this paper is fairly
                                prototypical for the literature. It analyses the concept from one angle, improves a bit
                                from the discussion already provided in previous works, and proceeds to propose a new
                                method variant. All of the development is sound and the method advances the field, but
                                the contribution is incremental. In particular, I do not see novel scientific insights
                                in this work. In conclusion, the work is worth publishing, but probably falls short of
                                the publication threshold for top-tier venues.
