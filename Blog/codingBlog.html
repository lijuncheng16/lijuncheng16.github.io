                <p> These days, coding interviews are like security checks before getting into big companies, and they
                    are getting more and more
                    competitive. It is not uncommon to hear someone fail coding rounds multiple times before he/she
                    could eventually
                    land in a halfway decent job.
                    Leetcode used to only have 300 questions, but now it's a whopping 1800. I actually got dinged twice
                    as well
                    in the beginning of the year, which is why I am here rethinking what I should do about this trend no
                    matter
                    it's for good or bad.</p>

                <p> I heard a lot of people (usually mid-senior level), of course, these are usually the losers of this
                    coding game, argue coding interviews are not reflective of the person's actual capability.
                    However, in the market driven economy, coding interview is a proven efficient way
                    to
                    screen people. As I was sitting across the table on the interview table back when I was working for
                    Bosch,
                    I understand the pain of not being able to select between a bunch of qualified candidates. A coding
                    round would
                    serve like an efficient weeder to weed out the "less proficient" candidates. Sometimes, as an
                    interviewer,
                    you cannot help but to feel a weird sense of achievement by crushing someone else's ego.</p>

                <p> The real question is how should I navigate given that I am graduating soon and the market is already
                    like this?
                    <b>Coding interview skills</b> are a little different than actual coding skills, since it is all
                    about
                    algorithms. In my years of experience of doing ML research, I never actually needed to use heap or
                    any fancy
                    data structures to process my data. Whereas at a coding prep site, there's almost 1 in 5 chance that
                    you can stumble upon on a heap question. Should I complain? Should I just keep doing research and
                    publish
                    papers and stay in academia? or should I get on the train and do leetcode as well? </p>

                <p> I guess I am more of a realistic person and my answer is to tackle the leetcode questions with a
                    clear structure of what I am doing, and try to
                    rebuild a stronger algorithmic foundation throughout this process. ML or stats or math skills are
                    like the 'devil fruit' power,
                    but coding skills, at the end of the day, are still the basic combat power to rely on in this
                    rapidly-evolving tech world.</p>

                <p> After doing LeetCode for a few month, I have several important epiphonies:
                <li>Interview coding is different from research coding; do it or not do, <b>stop whining</b> since
                    there's not much use complaining;
                </li>
                <li>Do questions <b>by categories</b> are way more efficient than do it randomly</li>

                <p> Stack questions on leetcode is not very intuitive. The questions, if not thought through carefully,
                    can easily fool you into O(n^2) solutions. The correct answers are most of times O(n).
                    <a href="https://github.com/lijuncheng16/codingInterview/blob/main/Stack.ipynb">Stack questions I
                        practiced</a>
                <li>One trick seems to be in the <code>while</code> loop within the <code>for</code> loop that goes
                    through the input.
                </li>
                <li>The other trick seems to be using 2-dimensional stack instead of one</li>
                Next time, if I see anything that requires to keep track of the previous elements, I should think about
                using the LIFO strategy to host that many elements in the stack and count them through popping them out
                of the stack.
