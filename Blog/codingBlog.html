            <div class="col-sm explanation">
                <p> These days, coding interviews are like security checks before getting into big companies, and they
                    are getting more and more
                    competitive. It is not uncommon to hear someone fail coding rounds multiple times before he/she
                    could eventually
                    land in a halfway decent job.
                    Leetcode used to only have 300 questions, but now it's a whopping 1800. I actually got dinged twice
                    as well
                    in the beginning of the year, which is why I am here rethinking what I should do about this trend no
                    matter
                    it's for good or bad.</p>

                <p> I heard a lot of people (usually mid-senior level), of course, these are usually the losers of this
                    coding game, argue coding interviews are not reflective of the person's actual capability.
                    However, in the market driven economy, coding interview is a proven efficient way
                    to
                    screen people. As I was sitting across the table on the interview table back when I was working for
                    Bosch,
                    I understand the pain of not being able to select between a bunch of qualified candidates. A coding
                    round would
                    serve like an efficient weeder to weed out the "less proficient" candidates. Sometimes, as an
                    interviewer,
                    you cannot help but to feel a weird sense of achievement by crushing someone else's ego.</p>

                <p> The real question is how should I navigate given that I am graduating soon and the market is already
                    like this?
                    <b>Coding interview skills</b> are a little different than actual coding skills, since it is all
                    about
                    algorithms. In my years of experience of doing ML research, I never actually needed to use heap or
                    any fancy
                    data structures to process my data. Whereas at a coding prep site, there's almost 1 in 5 chance that
                    you can stumble upon on a heap question. Should I complain? Should I just keep doing research and
                    publish
                    papers and stay in academia? or should I get on the train and do leetcode as well? </p>

                <p> I guess I am more of a realistic person and my answer is to tackle the leetcode questions with a
                    clear structure of what I am doing, and try to
                    rebuild a stronger algorithmic foundation throughout this process. ML or stats or math skills are
                    like the 'devil fruit' power,
                    but coding skills, at the end of the day, are still the basic combat power to rely on in this
                    rapidly-evolving tech world.</p>

                <p> After doing LeetCode for a few month, I have several important epiphonies:
                <li>Interview coding is different from research coding; do it or not do, <b>stop whining</b> since
                    there's not much use complaining;
                </li>
                <li>Do questions <b>by categories</b> are way more efficient than do it randomly! Remember common
                    patterns!
                </li>
                <li>Need to take notes and <b>Review!</b> we human beings eventually succumb to the <a

                    forgetting curve</a></li>
                <li><b>Discipline, Discipline and Discipline!</b> Laziness it the biggest enemy.</li>
                <li>Write succinct code! Short code but readable. Try to cut to the chase ASAP intead of trying brute
                    force first!
                </li>
                <li>Try to explain every major implementation step or motivation. Carve out the data structure, sudo
                    code, and try to list out several edge cases.
                </li>
                <li>Try to talk like a likeable person during interview: positive, smart, good technical habits, and
                    willingness to listen and debug.
                </li>
                <li>Eventually, muscle memories work faster than the brain, there are patterns in each categories, and
                    would need to memorize.
                </li>
                <li>Thought process is more important than actual coding, need to let people see why you are doing
                    what.

                <p> Stack questions on leetcode is not very intuitive. The questions, if not thought through carefully,
                    can easily fool you into O(n^2) solutions. The correct answers are most of times O(n).

                </li>
                <li>The other trick seems to be using 2-dimensional stack instead of one</li>
                Next time, if I see anything that requires to keep track of the previous elements, I should think about
                using the LIFO strategy to host that many elements in the stack and count them through popping them out
                of the stack.

            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p> Heap questions are intrinsically more challenging. Leetcode lists almost all the heap questions
                    above
                    medium difficulty. But once you get used to them, everything would
                    look very similar to you. Especially, once you are familiar with the idea of keeping priority queue
                    in 2D heap and how to use 2 heaps to tackle a moving stream of data, all other heap questions would
                    be similar derivative or variant questions.

            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p> Tree questions are mostly revolving around BST(Binary Search Trees), and to grasp BST well, I really
                    think the best way is to go back and read CLRS thoroughly and understand every bit they say about
                    BSTs.
                    <a href="https://github.com/lijuncheng16/codingInterview/blob/main/Tree.ipynb">Tree questions I
                        practiced</a>
                <li>Search O(height)</li>
                <li>Find min, max, successor, predecessor O(height)</li>
                <li>Insert O(height)</li>
                <li>Delete: This one is tricky since it can involve 2 different cases. still O(height)
                    tho<b>Transplant:</b>replaces one subtree
                    as a child of its parent with another tree.
                </li>
                <li>Rotation: This operation is needed for red-black tree or more advanced tree structures.</li>
                Tree questions involve BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's algorithm, and lots lots of recursions. This topic is one of
                the
                most important topic and definite worth spending more time on it. I took 2 weeks going through many
                tree-based
                questions, and I still feel I am not mastering tree 100%.
                There are couple of important notes:
                <li>Remember sub-category of tries, treaps.</li>
                <li>Be sure to get the recursion base case/ terminate case first. e.g. (#543 diameter of the tree, #199
                    rightside)
                </li>
                <li>Get comfortable to use Stack for DFS and queue for BFS, they run faster and more intuitive to
                    understand
                </li>
                <li>Serialize/deserialize , construct tree from preorder+inorder list, postorder+inorder list</li>
                <li>Get comfortable with recursion.</li>
